# students-learning-panel
This is a website where students are able to create their notes, search for any kind of books they want, infact there is an option where we can browse through youtube videos and search them. There is also a dictinoray for finding the meanings of new words along with examples. And at last there is a wikipedia section where we can search for any kind of information. I also made sure that my site is secure and reliable with the help of TLS latest version.

I have used API's for this project. 
For databases purpose i have used Azure For PostgreSQL(single server). 
And for the deployement of this website I used Azure Web Apps. 
And also through VS code it was to deploy my code quickly and efficiently.

# students-learning-panel

This is a learning panel website where we students are able to create our notes, search for any kind of books we want, infact there is an option where we can browse through YouTube videos and search them. There is also a dictionary to find the meanings of new words along with examples. And at last there is a wikipedia section where we can search for any kind of information we want. I also made sure that my site is secure and reliable with the help of TLS 1.2 version and HTTPS 2.0

Note: Registering to this website is compulsory to unlock all sections such as todo, Wikipedia, dictionary etc.

I have used API's for this project. 
For databases purpose I have used Azure For PostgreSQL(single server). 
For the deployment of this website I have used Azure Web Apps. The easiest part was that through Visual Code Studio it was easy to deploy my code quickly and efficiently.
